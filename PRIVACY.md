# Privacy Policy

## Last updated: November 24th, 2025

### 1. Overview

Wonderland Explorer is built to respect user privacy.
This bot **does not collect, store, or track any personal information** from Discord users.

The only data handled is related to displaying **Miliastra Wonderland Level information**, which is not linked to any user identity.

### 2. Data Collected

Wonderland Explorer processes only the following **non-personal** data:

#### 2.1 Level Cover Image (Temporary)

* Pulled when a user requests level information.
* Uploaded to the Discord CDN for display.
* The local file is **deleted immediately** after upload.
* No long-term storage occurs on the bot’s infrastructure.

#### 2.2 Level Metadata

* Includes game-related data such as level names, images, and attributes for displaying said data.
* Publicly available in-game information, not tied to any user or account.
* No logs or databases store this data persistently.

### 3. Data NOT Collected

Wonderland Explorer does **not** collect, store, analyze, or transmit:

* Usernames or Discord IDs
* Message content
* Server information
* IP addresses
* Location data
* Device or browser information
* Any personally identifiable information (PII)
* Any analytics or tracking data

### 4. Data Retention

Wonderland Explorer retains **no user data**.

Temporary images created during commands are removed immediately after upload.
Discord may store the image on its CDN according to **Discord’s own policies**, which are independent of Wonderland Explorer.

### 5. Third-Party Services

Wonderland Explorer interacts only with:

* **Discord API** (to receive commands and send messages)
* **Discord CDN** (to upload temporary images)

The bot does not share data with external services beyond Discord’s infrastructure.

### 6. User Rights

Because Wonderland Explorer stores no personal data:

* There is no personal data to request, export, modify, or delete.
* However, users may contact the developer for clarification or concerns.

### 7. Contact Information

For privacy questions or developer contact, please contact the developer via email: [miliastra@studiobutter.io.vn](mailto:miliastra@studiobutter.io.vn) or [butter@studiobutter.io.vn](mailto:butter@studiobutter.io.vn)
